# Big Notation

## Overview

We will to cover the famouus big-O notation and the NP-Completeness theory and also take a look at how we can have some fun
with algorithms and boost our knowledge to improve our programming and problem-solving skills.

## Understanding big-O notation
How do we measure the efficiency of an algorithm ? We usually use resources such as CPU (time) usage, memory usage, disk usage, and
network usage. When talking about big-O notation, we usually consider CPU (time) usage 

## O(1)

Consider the following function:

```js
function increment(num){
    return ++num;
}
```
If we try to execute the increment(1) function, we will have an execution time equal to x. If we try to execute
