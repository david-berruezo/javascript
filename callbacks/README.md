# Callback Function

## Overview

We'll introduce, define, and work with callback functions.

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

Here is a quick example:
```js
function greeting(name) {
  alert('Hello ' + name);
}

function processUserInput(callback) {
  var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
  callback(name);
}

processUserInput(greeting);
```

The above example is a synchronous callback, as it is executed immediately.

Note, however, that callbacks are often used to continue code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed â€” these are called asynchronous callbacks. A good example is the callback functions executed inside a .then() block chained onto the end of a promise after that promise fulfills or rejects. This structure is used in many modern web APIs, such as fetch().

Commons examples

```js
let button = document.querySelector('.mi_boton');
button.addEventListener('click',function(){
    console.log('i"m a callback');
});

```

or in arrays


```js
let vector = ["apple","pear","banana"];
vector.forEach(function(element,index,array)){
    console.log(element);
});

```
