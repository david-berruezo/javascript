### 01.- Notation

#### Overview

We will to cover the famouus big-O notation and the NP-Completeness theory and also take a look at how we can have some fun
with algorithms and boost our knowledge to improve our programming and problem-solving skills.

### 02.- Primitive

#### Overview

There are exactly five primitive data types in JavaScript: string, number, boolean, null,
and undefined. Only the string, number, and boolean data types have complementary
constructor objects. The actual representation of strings, floating-point numbers, integers,
and booleans are literals:

### 03.- String

#### Overview

String a primitive data types in JavaScript, in this section you can see a several scripts to work with strings, for example, 
look for variables, extract substrings, manipulate substrings etc

### 04.- Arrays

#### Overview

The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, list-like objects.

Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses to use them. In general, these are convenient characteristics; but if these features are not desirable for your particular use, you might consider using typed arrays.

Arrays cannot use strings as element indexes (as in an associative array) but must use integers. Setting or accessing via non-integers using bracket notation (or dot notation) will not set or retrieve an element from the array list itself, but will set or access a variable associated with that array's object property collection. The array's object properties and list of array elements are separate, and the array's traversal and mutation operations cannot be applied to these named properties.


### 05.- Objects

#### Overview

The Object class represents one of JavaScript's data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax.



### 06.- Modules

#### Overview

Use of native JavaScript modules is dependent on the import and export statements, the browser compatibility of which is as follows (numbers in green boxes are probably the release version of respective platform which support the feature):
