# JavaScript Functions

## Overview

We'll introduce, define, and work with functions. 


A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

```js
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
}
```
